Includes some of the projects I've worked on.

## AQM-Bank-Marketing-Data-Best-Model
Aim was to find the best model to predict whether a client would open a deposit or not,
based only on the 6 different models that had been used during class.

#### Improvements:

Should not have used the test set to find  optimal threshold.

Could try with other models not taught in class.

Should have tried to use the validate set more.

Can explore data using different visualization tools
